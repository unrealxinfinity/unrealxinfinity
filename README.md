### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is HaoChang Fu

  I'm a student in Informatics Engineering and Computing (LEIC and MEIC in short) currently studying at FEUP and I am very keen on technology, it's always been a passion of mine so I usually tend to be on par of latest tech innovations.
  Now that I've been introduced to the world of programming, I'd love to use the code to make things work.
  
  If you wish to see my CV it's linked [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF6PCpI4SU/TLYp_GXJ8nvYkXKiGgwn4Q/edit?utm_content=DAF6PCpI4SU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).
  I also have my own website [here](https://haochangwebsite.netlify.app/)!
> PS: I'll keep updating this during my Master's journey.
### Here are some things I've worked on through my journey:
