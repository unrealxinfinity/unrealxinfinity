### Hi there 👋
### My name is HaoChang Fu

  I'm a student in Informatics Engineering and Computing (LEIC in short) currently studying at FEUP and I am very keen on technology, it's always been a passion of mine so I usually tend to be on par of latest tech innovations.
  Now that I've been introduced to the world of programming, I'd love to use the code to make things work.
> PS: I'll update this with my journey during Master's degree once exam period is over.
### Here are some things I've worked on through my journey:
